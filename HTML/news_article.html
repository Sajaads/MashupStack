                <p>India’s Olympic contingent are devastated after one of their marquee athletes, the female wrestler <strong>Vinesh Phogat</strong>, was disqualified hours before her gold medal match for exceeding the 50kg restriction by the weight of a <em>medium-sized banana</em> (100 grams) despite even cutting off her hair in an attempt to fight for gold.</p>
                <p>The prime minister of India, Narendra Modi, took to social media to express his “despair” over the highly unusual situation involving the athlete nicknamed the Lioness of India.</p>
                <p>Phogat had been due to face Sarah Hildebrandt of the United States in Thursday evening’s final. The Indian had been within the designated weight before three fights on Tuesday but had to be tested again on Wednesday morning in accordance with competition rules. Phogat had been running and skipping overnight in an attempt to lower her weight, but failed by only 100 grams.</p>
                <p>Phogat had reduced Japanese journalists to tears by defeating the top seed Yui Susaki in the opening round of the competition on Wednesday. She already had a huge reputation in her own country; Phogat slept on the streets of New Delhi in protest at sexual allegations within her sport.</p>
                
                <p>Here are some key details of the event:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Vinesh was one of the top contenders for the gold medal.</li>
